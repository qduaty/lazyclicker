1. place a new small window, if there's already a big window pushed away a 
corner but no window in the opposite corner, in that opposite corner to fill
the gap
2. rework the concept of free corners to sides occupation:
- each side has 2 corners and the middle
- small windows occupy sides in multiples of 2 (in opposite corners)
- a big window occupies entire side (2 corners and the middle)
3. change the calculation of a big window to include resize amount - and make that one 250px by default
