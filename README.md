# arrangewindows
Arrange all visible windows on Windows screens so that all have a visible corner. This is meant to be used with no-click window raise (a mouse accessibility option), so that all windows can be accessed without clicking. Maximized or prearranged windows will be slightly reduced, and windows that spanned multiple screens will be reduced to a single screen.
